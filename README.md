This project demonstrates how to use [`react-intl-redux`](https://github.com/ratson/react-intl-redux) to provide i18n support in a React/Redux application. It also includes a demo language picker component.

To use, clone the repository, then `npm install` and `npm run` from the root (where `package.json` is). The app will start running and you can visit the URL it tells you to.

Note: Language files are in `/build/messages/`. For this demo, `en.json` and `it.json` are pre-built so they can be used right away. To build again, do `npm run translate`. For more information, see `/scripts/translate.js` or this tutorial for [`react-intl`](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/internationalization-in-react-7264738274a0#.4qb9qnmzv).
