This project demonstrates how to use [`react-intl-redux`](https://github.com/ratson/react-intl-redux) to provide i18n support in a React/Redux application. It also includes a demo language picker component.

To use, clone the repository, then `npm install` and `npm run` from the root (where `package.json` is). The app will start running and you can visit the URL it tells you to.
